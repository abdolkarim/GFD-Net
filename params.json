GFD-Net can analyze a gene network based on Gene Ontology (GO) and calculate a quantitative measure of its functional coherence, i.e. a quantitative value of the degree of similarity between the connected genes in it.\r\n\r\n### What else\r\nAfter the analysis, users can visualize the information retrieved from GO.\r\nFor each gene the user can see its associated GO terms and its function (specified by a GO term) chosen as the most cohesive function in the set.\r\n```\r\nImage of the node result panel\r\n```\r\nFor each edge the user can see the genes at its ends, the function chosen as the most cohesive function in the set for each one and the dissimilarity between them.\r\n```\r\nImage of the edge result panel\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How the algorithm works\r\nGFD-Net is based on an adaptation of the GFD approximation presented in Díaz Díaz and Aguilar Ruiz, 2011 <http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/360>. Both approximations use the prior biological knowledge contained in GO to establish the quality of new genetic models. The main difference between them is that GFD ignores the particular relationships that can be between the genes in the model while GFD-Net do not ignore them. Because of that GFD is oriented to gene sets validation and GFD-Net is oriented to gene network validation.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm receive the network  and return the result using a optimize structure for best performance execution time and memory usage. It perform the analysis in three steps:\r\n\r\n-- Scan all nodes using the GFD approximation\r\nExplain the extrapolation of GFD (see Díaz Díaz and Aguilar Ruiz, 2011 <http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/360> for details).\r\n\r\n-- Include in each node all the information retrieved in the previous step.\r\nAll the genes that can not be found in the selected ontology are removed and the GO terms associated to each gene are included in its node.\r\n\r\n-- Evaluate the graph.\r\nEach edge is weighting using the functional dissimilarity function (R) and the dissimilarity value of the network is calculated based on these weights.\r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\nAll the information about installation and use of GFD-Net can be found in the User Manual included when downloading the plugin for here or at http://usermanualgfdnet.com\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nNorberto Díaz Dúaz (@nbidiaz), Juan José Dïaz Montaña (@juanjoDiaz), Isabel A Nepomuceno-Chamorro and Francisco A.
